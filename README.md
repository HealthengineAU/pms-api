The Healthengine Practice Management Software (PMS) API is designed to enable authorised third-party developers to create integrations that facilitate data synchronisation between Healthengine and their software solutions.

This integration serves the purpose of displaying bookable resources and their availability on the Healthengine booking platform.

Following your initial review of our API definition, we strongly recommend referring to our [quick start guide](docs/quick-start-guide.md) . This guide outlines the necessary steps to establish a functional integration and the subsequent procedures for going live once the development phase is concluded.

Additionally, the [suggested testing document](docs/suggested-testing.md) outlines common and edge use cases that your integration should be designed to accommodate throughout the development process.
